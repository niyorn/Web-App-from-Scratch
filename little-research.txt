Frameworks in General


Pro
-A good programmer know how to get the job done well and fast. If you don’t need to write code from scratch why should you? Frameworks are just tools, tools that any profession has to work better. 

-Efficiency is also about lines of code.


Con
-If you don't know the underlying principles of the web, you'll eventually hit a wall thanks to the evolution of the language itself and the constant arrival of new frameworks.

-People start using frameworks and libraries without even thinking about how to solve the problem without them. Often, a solution in VanillaJS is very easy, but people are so used to work with frameworks and libraries that they load a lot of extra code to do very simple things.
